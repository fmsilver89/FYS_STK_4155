The main purpose of the project was to successfully predict the election outcome of 2012 and 2016 in the US based on certain variables, as well as identify the most important variables. The variables analyzed ranged from economics, ethnicity and education, among other variables. The data was first joined together into a design matrix and further standardized.

Various machine learning algorithms was deployed for completing the task, where accuracy score was the main metric. Support vector machine (SVM) with a kernel produced the best classification test results of 89\% for the 2012 election and 96\% for the 2016. Neural networks performed almost as good with 87\% for 2012 and 94\% for 2016, while logistic regression came out slightly worse.

The variables that contributed the most for correct classification were the age and population size of the counties. Regarding flipped counties between the elections, the applied methods hinted that the percentage of females and whites may have had a minor impact on the shift from one party to another.
