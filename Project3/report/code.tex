\section{Code implementation}
The Python programming language is used for implementation of the methods. The Python packages Numpy, Scikit learn and Tensorflow with Keras are used extensively because of their rich functionality. In terms of computational time, the Tensorflow package operate a few orders of magnitude faster compared to self-implemented codes, developed directly from our understanding of the theory. Therefore, the focus has been on using the Python packages when running the calculations.
